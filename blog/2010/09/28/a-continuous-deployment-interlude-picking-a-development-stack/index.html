<div class="entry-content"><div>
<div>At some point in time, you&#8217;re going to have to pick a set of tools to do your dev work with. You probably want a bunch of things, including:</div>
<div><ol>
<li>A version control system. Preferably not CVS, Visual SourceSafe, ClearCase, Perforce, RCS, SCCS&#8230;</li>
<li>A ticketing system. Preferably not Trac.</li>
<li>A code review system, possibly just informal code review as part of the ticketing system.</li>
</ol></div>
<div>Like pretty much everyone, I&#8217;m not without bias. I <em>love</em> Bazaar. It&#8217;s the best version control system I&#8217;ve ever used (and I&#8217;ve used most of the popular ones). I&#8217;ve got a number of reasons why I prefer it over git and hg, but I&#8217;m not going to debate VCSes here. All of the version control systems I&#8217;ve just named are all pretty great pieces of software, far superior to what we had to put up with before we had them. That&#8217;s unfortunate, because then&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_Law_of_Triviality" target="_blank">Parkinson&#8217;s law of triviality</a>&nbsp;comes into effect, and people who really don&#8217;t even care very much either way will feel the need to defend their favorite piece of software to the death. I think we should come to terms with VCS wars being the new editor wars. (The inverse relation between clue and volume is an unfortunate perennial in these things.)</div>
<p />
<div>At my old place of work, we found a way around that. We had an SVN trunk, and no human was allowed to commit to it. There&#8217;s a bot takes patches which commits to trunk &#8211; and patches are only sent after two (later three) people sign off on the code review. One obvious advantage is that you completely avoid religious wars. I don&#8217;t have to convince people to switch to $AWESOME_VCS. There&#8217;s also the problem of authorship erasure: because the bot commits everything and this was a very simplistic bespoke system, tools like <span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">svn blame</span> stop working. At first sight, this seems pretty bad. I&#8217;m not entirely convinced: it&#8217;s not great, but on the other hand, it is a sort-of neat way of enforcing collective code ownership. Overall, I think this was a nice experiment, but it&#8217;s about time we stop mucking around and build some better tools.</div>
<p />
<div>I started by looking all of the hosted services and the DVCS that powers them:</div>
<div><ol>
<li>Launchpad with Bazaar.</li>
<li>Bitbucket with Mercurial</li>
<li>Github with git (and <a href="http://github.com/defunkt/hub">hub</a>)</li>
</ol></div>
<div>Because of my affinity for Bazaar, Launchpad obviously came first.&nbsp;Alas, there&#8217;s a problem with Launchpad for small commercial projects. Pricing.</div>
<p />
<div>[[posterous-content:shOrCG05NvDQO8UBylbu]]</div>
<div>Here&#8217;s how it works. Github (in dark red) has a <a href="http://github.com/plans" target="_blank">bunch of plans for private repositories</a>. Bitbucket (in light blue) has a <a href="http://bitbucket.org/plans" target="_blank">bunch of plans for private repositories</a>. Launchpad (in yellow) has a <a href="https://launchpad.net/+tour/join-launchpad" target="_blank">one size fits all $250/yr/project plan</a>.</div>
<p />
<div>I am in no way saying $250 is an unsurmountable amount of money for a company. I am saying that at the low end of the spectrum, you get a whole lot more bang for your buck at Github and especially Bitbucket than you get at Launchpad. The services they provide are not equivalent: merge proposals are quite a bit better than pull requests in both Github and Bitbucket (although Github&#8217;s Pull Request 2.0&#8217;s are halfway there, their pull-request-is-an-issue philosophy makes it impossible to use pull requests as proposed solutions to tickets), and the issue tracker feels a lot more polished than both Github&#8217;s and Bitbucket&#8217;s (although between those two, Bitbucket probably wins that round). I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s not better. I&#8217;m saying I&#8217;m having a hard time justifying that it&#8217;s around $200/year/project better. It&#8217;s not that Launchpad&#8217;s expensive as much as the&nbsp;competition&nbsp;is really, really cheap.</div>
<p />
<div>Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m a tiny bootstrapping startup with somewhere between $10k and $30k to spend. If you&#8217;ve got one project, $250/yr that&#8217;s quite all right. However, building your big app as a set of smaller ones has a number of advantages, in terms of administration and deployment. Once I&#8217;ve got 5+ tiny projects (which, put together, make up the code in my startup), it&#8217;s about $1250/yr. Still not insurmountable, but I&#8217;ve got more interesting things to spend $1k+ on than Launchpad. $1k/year for hosting is not a sensible way to spend your money when most of those projects only get a few tickets a week.</div>
<p />
<div>So, just to be clear: I&#8217;m not saying Launchpad sucks. I think Launchpad is great. I&#8217;m not saying Launchpad&#8217;s pricing scheme is asinine. I&#8217;m saying their pricing scheme works out very badly for what I want to do, and that I&#8217;m having a hard time convincing other people the extra cost is worth the difference in functionality.</div>
<p />
</div>
<div>In the next post, I&#8217;ll talk about rolling your own development stack.</div>
