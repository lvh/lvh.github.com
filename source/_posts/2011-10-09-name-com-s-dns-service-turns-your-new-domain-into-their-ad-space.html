title: Name.com's DNS "service" turns your new domain into their ad space
published: true

<p>... and no, they don't let you turn it off.</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>Register any domain with name.com (using their DNS, which is the default)</li>
<li>Connect to <a href="http://nonexistent.contromercial.com">http://nonexistenthostname.yourdomain.com</a></li>
<li>Observe parking page.</li>
</ol>
<p>For now, I'll be using Linode's DNS management tools (which are pretty great). I'm moving my future business to <a href="http://gandi.net">Gandi</a>, and so should you.</p>
